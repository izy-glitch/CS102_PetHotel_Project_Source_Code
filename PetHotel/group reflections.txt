Group Reflections: 
Through this project we got a chance to improve our collaborative working skills. 
We practiced CS102 course subjects.
We learned to work in a limited time and still manage to complete vital parts.
We learned to work at several different occasions, such as studying for the lecture 
itself and working on the project at the same time. Both occasions took a lot of time, 
so we learned to manage our time, and leave enough time for both responsibilities.
We learned to implement and modify different parts of a code and make it work.
The limited time had a negative effect on our project work so that was something we all disliked.
During the implementation of the project, we slightly had to change what was planned in the first 
version of the detailed design report since we realized extra needed methods or unnecessary parts 
that needed to be removed.
We should not have trusted solely on the database: We could have added a user and other classes to 
store data.
We spent at least three hours for each report at the beginning of the semester and every week we put 
more time into project stages. Especially in the last few weeks we spent most of our daily time making 
the project.
We have all completed all classes that we are responsible with.
We learned and practised many topics such as MVC design pattern, mail sending, and other swing classes.
Overall, having more time to implement the code could result in better solutions but we are still 
satisfied with what we have done in such busy and limited days.
